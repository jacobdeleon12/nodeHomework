LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Getting Started

To run program I needed to have unique Spotify Keys to run the Spotify API. I've included short gifs of said program working.   

### Prerequisites

To run this program Asios/Moment/Spotify npmâ€™s are needed to be installed. They should be found in the package.json. All Found on npmjs.com. As well as unique keys for bandsintown/spotify/omdbapi

```
npm i node-spotify-api
```
```
npm i moment
```
```
npm i axios
```

### Installing


```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

How to run the program. Liri has a few commands that it knows. "concert-this"(artist)"spotify-this-song"(song name)"movie-this"(movie name)"do-what-it-says"(reads a command from a txt file). The user needs to tell liri what you want to do then add what they want to do after the command.
